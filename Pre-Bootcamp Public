- 👋 Hi, I’m @BlakeGreeley
- 👀 I’m interested in creating worlds with code that could never exist outside of the code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and am currently enrolled in CodingDojo's Bootcamp to teach me to be a Fullstack developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that gets my gears turning in my head. 
- 📫 How to reach me, is through my discord @Blake_Greeley
